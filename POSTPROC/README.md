# Temporary Backup of CN Analysis Scripts

This repository contains a **temporary backup** of the Python functions and scripts I'm currently developing for my coordination number (CN) analysis workflow.

These files are **not final** â€” they are uploaded here **only as a safety copy** in case something goes wrong locally or I need to restore progress.

The **final and cleaned version** of the code (with proper documentation, structure, and tests) will be uploaded once the project is completed.

---

## Notes
- These scripts may contain experimental or partially tested functions.
- File names and function signatures might change in the final version.
- Please do not consider this repository as a stable or production-ready codebase.
